Aim:-
This project aims to successfully recognise handwritten digits using a deep Neural Network.
Approach:-
A sequential approach is followed. The steps followed are:-
	(1) Importing the keras-libraries
	(2) Importing the data
	(3) Visualising the data
	(4) Designing the model
	(5) Visualising the first layer and observing the weights before training
	(6) Compiling the model
	(7) Training the model
	(8) Testing the model
	(9) Visualising the first layer and observing the weights after training
			 This step helps us to visualise that:-
						(1)This internal representation reflects Latent Variables
						(2)Each of the nodes will look for a specific pattern in the input
						(3)A node will get activated if input is similar to the feature it looks for
						(4)Each node is unique and often orthogonal to each other
	(10) Predicting the digit at the index of the test set and visualising the final prediction with the help of a thresholded output
Conclusion :-
	Training and Testing accuracy are noted.
	(1) Training Accuracy :- 94.05%
	(2) Testing Accuracy :- 94.11%
	Thus the model is a "Good Fit"!
