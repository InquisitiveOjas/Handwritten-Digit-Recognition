# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
 Handwriting recognition is one of the most difficult problems of pattern  recognition and artificial intelligence. Unlike the machine generated character, which is  uniform throughout a document and often uniform between machines, each human being  has a unique style of writing characters. Training a computer to recognize human-produced characters is a tremendous task.
This is an attempt to recognise digits using ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS!
